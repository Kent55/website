					<h3>Latest Testimonial</h3>
					<p><small>&quot;I was really impressed with the service that Matt provided when building my website. He was quick to respond to emails, and was courteous and patient throughout.

He immediately understood the visual effect that I wanted and quickly set about making it happen. He helped me make decisions about image selection based on that brief, and was happy to help me tweak the site until it was perfect.<br /><br />

The website I ended up with was everything I needed and wanted. Matt is someone I would return to - if I wanted to develop the site or make changes - because he is so easy to deal with and has a great combination of technical know-how and exceptional customer service. I was really impressed with the service that Matt provided when building my website. He was quick to respond to emails, and was courteous and patient throughout.&quot; <br /><br />

				<p>Roo Green - WordPress Blog</p>
				<p class="sub-port-item"><small>Roo came to me in need of a blog. She wanted something personal to her, that provided a platform that she could use to communicate with her readers. Roo made it clear she was after simplicity, yet elegance. So, after a few custom plugins, SEO and ever-changing content she now has 1000+ readers a month and counting.</small></p>
